# Search Insert Position

# Given a sorted array of distinct integers and a target value, return the index if the target is found. 
# If not, return the index where it would be if it were inserted in order.

# You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.

# Example 1:
# Input: nums = [1,3,5,6], target = 5
# Output: 2

# Example 2:
# Input: nums = [1,3,5,6], target = 2
# Output: 1

class Solution:
    def searchInsert(self, nums: [int], target: int) -> int:

        left, right = 0, len(nums) - 1

        while left <= right:
            mid = (left + right) // 2
            if nums[mid] == target:
                return mid
            elif nums[mid] < target:
                left = mid + 1
            else:
                right = mid - 1
        
        # If target is not found, return the position where it should be inserted
        return left
